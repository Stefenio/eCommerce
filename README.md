# 🛍️ eCommerece: A simple, cross platform, modulith, micro-services built on .NET Core

> `ECommerece` is a fictional sample, built with .NET Core and different software architecture and technologies like **Microservices Architecture**, **Vertical Slice Architecture** , **CQRS Pattern**, **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**, **Event Driven Architecture**. For communication between independent services, we use asynchronous messaging with using rabbitmq on top of [MassTransit](https://github.com/MassTransit/MassTransit) library, and sometimes we use synchronous communication for real-time communications with using REST and gRPC calls.
